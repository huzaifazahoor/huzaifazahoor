## About Me

I'm a data engineer currently working at MLSense, where I specialize in Django and Python. With a strong foundation in data engineering principles and tools, I enjoy building scalable and efficient data pipelines and working with large datasets. My experience includes designing and implementing data models, optimizing data processing workflows, and ensuring data quality and reliability.

## Skills

- Python
- Django
- Airflow
- Data Modeling
- Data Pipelines
- SQL
- ETL
- Big Data Technologies

## Projects

Here are a few notable projects I've worked on:

1. **Airflow Pipeline**: Developed a data pipeline using Apache Airflow to process and transform streaming data from multiple sources into a centralized data warehouse.
2. **Django JWT Auth**: Developed a Django application that provides JWT-based authentication functionality. This project simplifies the process of adding authentication to Django applications, allowing users to securely register, login, and manage their accounts using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

   - Implemented user registration, login, and password reset functionality.
   - Integrated JWT authentication for secure and stateless user sessions.
   - Used Django Rest Framework for building the API endpoints.
   - Ensured secure handling of user passwords using bcrypt hashing.

   Check out the project [here](https://github.com/huzaifazahoor/django-jwt-auth) for more details.

Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories for more projects and code samples.
